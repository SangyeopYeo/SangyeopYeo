## Hi guys! 👋
I'm sangyeop. I obtained B.S.(2021) degree from Electrical and Computer Engineering at Ajou University.

Currently, I'm a M.S. & Ph.D. course student at Laboratory of Advanced Imaging Technology (LAIT) in the Artificial Intelligence Graduate School (AIGS) at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), under the supervision of Prof.Jaejun Yoo.

My main research area lies at the intersection of ***multi-modal generative models*** and ***efficient, personalized generative models***.

I am very interested in understanding and expressing the world we live in. Generative models are a powerful way to model our world, and I have a strong interest in them to better express the real world. To achieve this, we need a deep understanding of the various modalities that make up the world, such as images, videos, 3D representations, language, and audio. I am particularly focused on multi-modal generative models that can effectively integrate these elements, and I also have a strong interest in foundation models to further enrich this expression.

Even if we model the world excellently, if only a few people can benefit from it, it cannot reach its true value. Therefore, I am also deeply interested in personalized generative models. In particular, my research focuses on computationally efficient and data-efficient generative models to address the cost challenges that pose significant barriers to personalization. Lightweight generative models and few-shot generation enable generative models to perform well in personal environments where computational resources and data are limited.

If you have a question about me, you can freely ask me anytime.
