Thank you for your interest!
The code has been pre-released, but we are currently refining it, and the trained weights will be available soon.

## Hi guys! 👋
I'm sangyeop. I obtained B.S.(2021) degree from Electrical and Computer Engineering at Ajou University.

Currently, I'm a M.S. & Ph.D. course student at Laboratory of Advanced Imaging Technology (LAIT) in the Artificial Intelligence Graduate School (AIGS) at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), under the supervision of Prof.Jaejun Yoo.

I am very interested in generative models to better understand the world. To achieve this, I need a deep understanding of language, video, audio, and 3D, and I am particularly focused on multi-modal generative models that can effectively integrate these elements. Additionally, I am addressing challenges related to lightweight models and few-shot learning to ensure they perform well in personal environments with limited data.

If you have a question about me, you can freely ask me anytime.
